# data-science-portfolio
This repo is designed to showcase different data science projects that I have worked on throughout my time in college. 
To view my entire portfolio and projects that I am working on feel free to visit www.jamespcarnes.com

If any of the jupyter notebooks above aren't rendering it most likely is due to issues Github is currently having with rendering notebooks. To work around this you can download the repo then open the html file locally for the corresponding notebook.

Thanks for stopping by!
